First of All, You inculde the Devise gem in your Gemfile, but you never used it, The Best Practice in your Rails App is to keep your Gemfile
as min as you can. If you are not using any gem, Don't include it the Gemfile.
Next Point is, its better approah to use some Predefined Functionality like the Devise Provide for the User Authentication, I Checked your ApplicationController and I noticed you defined all the function like accessing current_user and more, Devise Provide this By default.
