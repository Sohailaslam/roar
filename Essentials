First of All, You inculde the Devise gem in your Gemfile, but you never used it, The Best Practice in your Rails App is to keep your Gemfile
as min as you can. If you are not using any gem, Don't include it the Gemfile.
Next Point is, its better approah to use some Predefined Functionality like the Devise Provide for the User Authentication, I Checked your ApplicationController and I noticed you defined all the function like accessing current_user and more, Devise Provide this By default.


For Controllers
---------------

I Provide all the Essential Details for the Controller in Article Controller, Remaining Controllers are little Better, But I prefer you to Use Gem Devise, So we can just skip this Code and modified it to much more optimized and less code

For Models
----------

It is Necessary to add the Validations in your Rails Model, Because validation is necessary otherwise your database is filled up with empty records like in the comments, There is no validation, so it's necessary to validate the each record.
